# Air Traffic Optimization

## Overview
This project aims to optimize air traffic management using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to improve the efficiency and safety of air traffic operations.

## Features
- **Predictive modeling for air traffic flow:** Utilize machine learning models to predict air traffic patterns and potential congestion.
- **Optimization algorithms for route planning:** Implement algorithms to find the most efficient routes for aircraft, reducing fuel consumption and delays.
- **Real-time traffic monitoring and analysis:** Monitor air traffic in real-time to provide actionable insights and improve decision-making.
- **Simulation tools for testing and validation:** Use simulation tools to test and validate the optimization algorithms under various scenarios.
